"The Star Chart" written by Gan De and "Astronomy" by Shi Shen of the Warring States Period (475 B.C.-221 B.C.) were the earliest star catalogues in the world. The two star charts presented in the books record positions of 120 stars. These positions, recorded 200 years earlier than those by other countries, are remarkably accurate, even by modern standards.
