The Great Wall of China is the longest and greatest wall in the world. Starting from the Shanhaiguan Pass in the east and ending at the Jiayuguan Pass in the west, it covers a total length of over 13,400 li (6,700 kilometres). If the bricks and stones that went into the construction of the Great Wall were used to pave a road five metres wide and 35 centimetres thick, it would encircle the globe three to four times.
